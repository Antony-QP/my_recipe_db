### Tech stack / Technologies
Build using the MERN stack and cloudinary to host images.

### How to use
As the application is not in production you will have to create your own cloudinary account and put your Cloduinary API_Key, 
API_Secret and Cloudinary name in your .env file on the server side.  Assign them to the correct variables so they match the variable names that you will find 
in backendUtils/cloudinary.js.  You wil also have to create your own DB on MongoAtlas.  After creating a db be sure to add your mongoURI to your default.json file 
in the config file.  You should also place your JWT secret in this default.json file as well in order for the authentication to work.
